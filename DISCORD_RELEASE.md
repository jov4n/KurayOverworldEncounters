**Kuray's Overworld Encounters!**

**Please note:** Mod menu needed to be edited a little bit, however, it should work the same. You may need to replace your mod menu with my copy. (sorry @stonewall)

This mod spawns wild Pokemon directly in the overworld that you can see and interact with! All features are toggle-able and customizable through Mod Settings.

**Requires:** ⁠Mod Settings
**Credits:** Based on Voltseon's Overworld Encounters, adapted by Fill to include fusion encounters, horde battles, and compatibility with Kuray's Infinite Fusion.
